    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g of sweet corn
        </li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>
            20 g of precooked corn flour</li>
        <li>60 ml of whole milk</li>
        <li>queso de mano (tierno o mozzarella)</li>
        <li>a tiny bit of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <p>We begin to prepare the Venezuelan cachapas recipe by grinding the sweet corn, sugar, salt, milk, pre-cooked corn
        flour and egg in a food processor or blender glass.

        By mixing the aforementioned ingredients we will obtain a dough that we will let rest in the refrigerator for
        half an hour in a kitchen bowl lined with plastic wrap. So far so good?

        The next step will be to heat a frying pan and add a little butter. When it melts and using a ladle or saucepan
        we add part of the previously prepared dough.

        Let it cook over medium heat until the dough begins to bubble and small holes appear (about 3 or 4 minutes). It
        will be time to turn it over using a kitchen spatula, for example.

        Venezuelan cachapas

        Like pancakes or quesadillas, once cooked, we will fill them with the selected cheese and close them, so that
        the latter melts slowly.

        Once the cachapas are well browned, we take them out, spread them with a little butter and serve them very warm
        and enjoy!

        Keep in mind that if you eat them freshly they are delicious, but you can keep them in the refrigerator for a
        couple of days. When you want to indulge again, heat them in a pan and that's it.
